# ML1819-Language-Detection-202-Team7
Machine Learning group research assignment on Language Detection using Machine Learning(ML) and Non Machine Learning(NML) approach. A comparison of ML vs NML to detect lanaguages.


The models are built to identify 6 different languages i.e. English, German, Portuguese, Italian, Spanish and French.
Two machine learning models i.e. Artificial Neural Network and SVM were trained on 3 trigrams.
One non machine learning model based on n-gram probability.
